## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### App Not Responding

```bash
# Check Railway logs
# Go to Railway dashboard → Deployments → View Logs

# Common issues:
# 1. Environment variables not set
# 2. Database connection failed
# 3. Build failed
```

### Database Connection Error

```bash
# Verify connection string
# Should look like: postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech:5432/db

# Test connection
psql "postgresql://user:pass@host.neon.tech:5432/db" -c "SELECT 1"
```

### Redis Connection Error

```bash
# Verify Redis settings
# Make sure REDIS_TLS=true for Upstash

# Test connection
redis-cli -h your-host.upstash.io -p 6379 -a your-password --tls PING
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Keep App Awake (Render only)

If using Render (which sleeps after 15 min):

```bash
# Use UptimeRobot to ping every 5 minutes
# This keeps your app awake for free!
```

### 2. Monitor Usage

Check your usage dashboards:
- **Railway**: https://railway.app/dashboard
- **Neon**: https://console.neon.tech
- **Upstash**: https://console.upstash.com

### 3. Optimize for Free Tier

```javascript
// Use connection pooling
const prisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: {
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL + '?connection_limit=3',
    },
  },
});

// Cache aggressively
const CACHE_TTL = 3600; // 1 hour
```
