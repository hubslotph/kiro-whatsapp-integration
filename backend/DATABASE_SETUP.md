# Database Setup Complete

## What Was Implemented

Task 2 from the implementation plan has been successfully completed. The following components have been created:

### 1. Prisma Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- **Users table**: Stores WhatsApp user information with phone numbers and workspace IDs
- **Sessions table**: Manages authentication sessions with JWT tokens and expiration
- **Settings table**: User preferences including notification settings and accessible directories
- **Audit Logs table**: Tracks all command executions for security and debugging

All tables include proper:
- Primary keys (UUID)
- Foreign key relationships with cascade delete
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Field mappings to snake_case database columns

### 2. Database Connection Utility (`src/db/prisma.ts`)
- Singleton pattern for connection reuse
- Automatic connection pooling via Prisma
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Connection health check function
- Environment-based logging configuration

### 3. Seed Script (`prisma/seed.ts`)
- Creates test users with phone numbers
- Generates active sessions with tokens
- Sets up user settings with notification preferences
- Creates sample audit log entries
- Includes data cleanup for development environment

### 4. Package Scripts
Added to `package.json`:
- `prisma:generate` - Generate Prisma Client
- `prisma:migrate` - Create and apply migrations
- `prisma:migrate:deploy` - Apply migrations in production
- `prisma:studio` - Open Prisma Studio GUI
- `prisma:seed` - Seed database with test data
- `db:setup` - Complete setup (generate + migrate + seed)

### 5. Documentation
- `prisma/README.md` - Database setup guide
- `src/db/README.md` - Database module usage guide
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md` - This file

### 6. Integration
Updated `src/index.ts` to:
- Test database connection on startup
- Include database status in health check endpoint
- Handle graceful shutdown with database disconnection

## Next Steps

To use the database:

1. **Set up PostgreSQL database**
   ```bash
   # Create database
   createdb kiro_whatsapp
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy .env.example to .env and update DATABASE_URL
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Run database setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run db:setup
   ```

This will:
- Generate Prisma Client
- Create database tables
- Seed with test data

## Verification

The implementation has been verified:
- ✅ Prisma Client generated successfully
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (no errors)
- ✅ All files created in correct locations
- ✅ Database connection utility properly typed
- ✅ Seed script ready for execution

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from the spec:
- **1.1**: Session management for authentication
- **1.4**: Active session tracking
- **6.2**: Settings storage and management
- **6.3**: Session revocation capability
